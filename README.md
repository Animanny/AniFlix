This project is built from the Google Sponsored, [Building a Java Recommendation Engine Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-recommender/home/welcome)

The course had me build a movie recommendation engine similar to the ones used in Netflix. It uses User Preference and weighted averages to find similar users to recommend movies the user may like.
